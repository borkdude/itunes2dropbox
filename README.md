itunes2dropbox
==============

Share the current playing song or selected songs from iTunes to your Dropbox public folder.
A public link will be copied to the clip board for instant sharing.

Installation
------------
Open `itunes2dropbox.applescript` in the Applescript editor and save
as an `<yourdropboxnumberhere>.scpt` in some directory of your
convenience. Insert your unique Dropbox number. This number can be
found as described below.

Public Dropbox Folder and the unique number
-------------------------------------------
If you don't have a public folder on your Dropbox account, visit
[this link](https://www.dropbox.com/enable_public_folder).
To get your unique Dropbox number, put a file in this directory on
your local Dropbox and right-click this file. Select Dropbox > Copy
Public link. This link will look something like
`https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3914693/fileyoujustshared.txt`.
The number in my case is `3914693`, your number will be different. 

Usage
----
In case a song is playing in iTunes and the script is executed, the
song will be copied to your public Dropbox folder. If iTunes isn't
playing, one or more selected songs will be copied. Only one public
link will be copied to the clipboard for sharing with your friends.
